# About the project

**Lipatant's Artefacts** is a data/resource pack adding artefacts to Minecraft Java.

These artefacts are special items that give different advantages.

Some grant bonuses that benefit certain playstyles, while others simply offer a little extra content.

The goal behind this pack is to **keep to the Minecraft spirit without making the vanilla content obsolete**.

You can find more information on [the wiki](https://lipatant.github.io/LipatantsArtefacts/).
